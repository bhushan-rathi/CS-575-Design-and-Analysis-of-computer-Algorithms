Multiple Algorithms are implemented
1. Created Phone Directory using Binary Search & Merge Sort with Time Complexity of O(lg n) & O(n lg n) respectively

2. Implemented Strassen's Matrix Mltiplication Algorithm to reduce time complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2.81) 

3. Implemented Tromino Tiling algorithm to deomonstrate Divide and Conquer strategy with time complexity of O(n^2)

4. Implemented Knapsack algorithm with bruteforce approach with time complexity O(2^n)

5. Implemented Knapsack algorithm with greedy approach with time complexity O(n lg n)

6. Implemented Knapsack algorithm with dynamic approach with time complexity O(nxw) where w is weight and n is no. of item
   O(nxw) its a pseudo-polynomial complexity which may becomes exponential as W increses

7. Implemented Dijktra algorithm using array as data structure with time complexity O(n^2)
