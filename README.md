Multiple Algorithms are implemented
1. Created Phone Directory using Binary Search & Merge Sort with Time Complexity of O(lg n) & O(n lg n) respectively
2. Implemented Strassen's Matrix Mltiplication Algorithm to reduce time complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2.81)  
3. Implemented Tromino Tiling algorithm to deomonstrate Divide and Conquer strategy with time complexity of O(n^2)
